        <p>A set of MDF signage for Dalton's then-fiance's bridal shower.
            Made using a jigsaw and a drill.
            Shortly after the bridal shower, both were sold.

        <p>A picnic table made from scratch, and a projector screen to accompany it.
            Both were created for a camp-themed bachelor/bachelorette party, and have since been well-used.
            The picnic table has held up to a full table of adults on more than one occasion, and the projector screen has survived the elements.

            A cabinet made from plywood and set on caster wheels.
            Originally planned to be a "gatorade" cabinet, where the 5L container stored inside would hold pre-mixed gatorade, 
            the cabinet has since become a water dispenser, with the gatorade available to be mixed after pouring.

        <p>
            A set of four maple coasters, 3 inches by 3 inches. 
            They were wet-sanded to ensure that the wood grains won't pop when condensation hits them, and because no finish was applied, they absorb water and do not stick to the cup that is placed on them. 
            These have been used around the house for months.
