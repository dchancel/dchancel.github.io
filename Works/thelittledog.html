            <p>The Little Dog was a game created for Global Game Jam 2021 in a small team of 3 people. 
                Inspired by the constellations and Greco-Roman mythology, The Little Dog follows "Canis Minor", as they seek to fix the night sky and reunite with their master, Orion. 
                Dalton participated in level design and game design, as well as C# contributions and content implementation. 
                He also got to experiment with puppet-style animation of Orion in Adobe Animate.
