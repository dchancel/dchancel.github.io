            <p>Plunder Ball was a year-long endeavour with a fluctuating team of 3-10 people in Unreal Engine 5. 
                Dalton's main role was as a producer, as well as going through the process of handling the entire publishing process on Steam. 
                Additionally, at the end of production, Dalton was working in Unreal Engine 5, in both C++ and blueprints, to address a number of unshippable and unpalatable bugs before release.
