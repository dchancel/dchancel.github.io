            <p>Pondskipper was a game made for the "Third Space Jam", a small jam which Dalton organized in June of 2024. 
                The theme was "winds of change", and the core mechanic of this game is wind.
                The gameplay is largely inspired by games like Vampire Survivors.
                The wind is rapidly changing the direction in which it blows, which the player (a sailboat with a canon) must either work with or fight against. 
                By defeating the trash-themed monsters within the pond, the player can collect sed trash, and recycle it into various upgrades such as increased health, increased firing rate, and increased damage.
