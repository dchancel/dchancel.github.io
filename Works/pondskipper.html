                    <p>Pondskipper was a game made for the "Third Space Jam", a small jam which Dalton organized in June of 2024. 
                        The theme was "winds of change", and the core mechanic of this game is wind.
                        The gameplay is largely inspired by games like Vampire Survivors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dalton led the design and programming of this game.
                        He created the health and damage systems, and made them interact with a progression system.
                        He also used polymorphism to create varied enemies that can perform melee attacks, ranged attacks, or a combination of both.
                        The enemies also supported different move speeds, health amounts, and behaviours.
                        He also introduced the mechanic of wind moving a sailboat and changing rapidly, prompting the player to either use the wind direction to their advantage or fight against it.
