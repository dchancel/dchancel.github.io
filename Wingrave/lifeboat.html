                    You dive behind a mast and some rigging before the Drogar commander can see you.
                    With all of the chaos unfolding around you, it is fairly simple to slink from cover to cover towards the lifeboats. 
                    Bursts of fire start to pop across the deck. You can tell that the Drogar are throwing glass canisters of a flammable oil onto the ship, which spark to life as soon as they are touched by flames.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    One such pop of oil lands rather close to you, and sends you recoiling backwards to fall on your butt.
                    The sound, or the sudden motion, or some combination therein alert a nearby soldier to your presence.
                    You lock eyes as you scuttle backwards on your hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They approach you with pure malice in their body language. This goes beyond a soldier- this is a mageslayer.
                    They carry a metal club adorned with spines similar to those on their armor, and you can almost hear them laughing as they approach.
                    Just as the mageslayer passes by the central mast, they swipe their club into it.
                    With one swift crack, the entire structure begins to topple down towards you.

                <p>
                    As it lands on the deck, you are covered in a large chunk of wood that broke off in the impact.
                    It feels like you could be safe here, maybe the mageslayer would assume that you had died in the crash.
                    You have wounds, but nothing that couldn't stand to fester for an hour or two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What will you do?
