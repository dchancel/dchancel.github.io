                The Eastern Nations are comprised of seven city-states on the eastern side of the continent of Bellarde.
                Most of these city-states are interchangeable with one another in terms of power or influence, all of which tend to jockey for "The Crown Seat".
                The current holder of The Crown Seat is Drogar, a massive city in the mountains where war and security support the economy.
                The citizens of Drogar, upon turning sixteen, are drafted into five years of military service, and are stationed throughout the Eastern Nations.
                With no war currently on, all of the Drogar soldiers are assigned to peacekeeping duties, many of whom lean on their own interpretation of what "peace" looks like.

                The Eastern Nations legislature, known colloquially as The Rampart, is located in the central city-state of Deen.
                It is comprised of representatives from all member states, and is led by the Keeper of Order.
                At this point in time, sed Keeper is Jeremiah Briggins, an old-fashioned man from Drogar, whose agenda is squarely focused on ensuring peace and unity among and within the states.

                The most recent law passed, and the reason for so many citizens desiring passage away from The Eastern Nations, was one that targeted and threatened any person using a link to the arcane forces.
                In the past, magehood had been viewed as a badge of honor, of being chosen by the Magi- a sort of group of arcane muses beyond this realm.
                Even now, mages view themselves as the good and the just, desiring to help those around them with their gifts.
                New values, however, have convinced the population that magic is unnatural, harmful, and to be demonized.
                These new values originated in Drogar's seat, a state which had never been blessed by a connection to the Magi.
