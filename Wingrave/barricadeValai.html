                    Your body moves before your mind can process what is happening.
                    There is something happening above-deck, and whatever it is, sounds dangerous.
                    This hold only has one entrance, an open arch with no door inside- it's an easy decision to start sealing and barricading the doorway with some of the crates strewn about.
                    Several of the other passengers join in and help you push larger and larger crates up against the entry.
                    While magic would be extremely useful in this situation, no mage would be able to access it on the open water.
                    Instead, you must rely on the collective strength and drive of yourself and the passengers around you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the doorway is filled with crates, as well as a number of other blockages preventing them from being easily moved, you feel a little safer.
                    More crashes are coming from up above, as well as a few screams from crew members.
                    The smell of burning has become more pungent since you awoke, and you notice that there is smoke slowly filling the hold.
                    Some of the passengers have taken the fabric from their makeshift beds and begun to cover their mouths and noses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You start to get the impression that barricading the entry may not have been the best decision.
                    As you look back over to the crates to determine how difficult they would be to remove, you notice that even more black smoke is pouring in from the direction of the entryway.
                    A voice calls out from the other side of the crates, deep and gruff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You wished to escape! Let this be your escape, you damned mages!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The boxes, you can see now, have been set ablaze from the other side.
                    Embers and flames lick up onto the wood and catch all of them on fire, one by one.
                    If there is to be any escape from this, now is the time for action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What will you do?
