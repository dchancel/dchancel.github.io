                You can feel the waves crash against the wooden hull of a large seafaring vessel, almost in-time with the crashes of thunder high above.
                You are in bed, or at least in a place where sleeping could theoretically occur. 
                It's closer to "fabric stretched over a pile of hay" than a traditional bed, but it was at least comfortable enough that you fell asleep on it.
                You are down in the underbelly of the ship, just at the water level, where a number of other travellers are asleep.
                There is a faint smell of something burning, likely something another occupant had been smoking. Nothing to be terribly concerned about.

                This ship, the Valai, is first and foremost a trade vessel. Most of its cargo is boxed-up, various fruits, tools, spices.
                There is only enough space on each of its journeys for a handful of non-crew passengers, and the desire for passage has been growing.
                You departed from Port Arlile in <a href="./nEasternNations.html">The Eastern Nations</a>, a conglomeration of city-states that all share certain draconic laws.
                Everyone who is travelling aboard this ship as a passenger, you can safely assume, is fleeing. Together, you are all on your way to the Isle of Wingrave.
            </p>

                You can hear yelling from above-deck, it sounds like something big is happening.
                You are still groggy, and not quite sure what the voices are saying. 
                It isn't until a loud crash shakes the structure around you that you are roused to your senses.
                All but a few of the other passengers in this hold are now wide-awake as well, looking up towards the source of the commotion.

                What will you do?
