                    You try to call upon the magi to give you access to any form of magic in this moment of need.
                    A ball of fire to push back the military, a cloud of rain to save the ship, nearly anything could be useful right now.
                    You strain to hear their voices through the veil, but no sound comes.
                    You know that to reach the magi, you must have a solid connection to the world. Aboard a vessel floating in the ocean, no such connection can be made.

                    The commander notices you, and begins to stomp towards you with his weapon drawn.
                    There is nowhere to run, you are surrounded by flames and soldiers.
                    This is the end for you.
