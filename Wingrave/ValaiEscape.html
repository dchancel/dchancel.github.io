                    You crawl out from under a mass of wood and nails.
                    The constant thunder and crashing waves rattle your senses.
                    The entire ship is going up in flames around you, even the Drogar soldiers have abandoned the vessel.
                    As you look around, you see no other living beings. Everyone who had been aboard this ship has either perished, or found their own way off.
                    The lifeboats are all gone- though you cannot tell if they were taken by survivors, or simply cut free by the Drogar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the only unscorched wood, you realize, is the wood that you have just crawled out from.
                    It is still held together well-enough by the nails, and could fit one, maybe two people.
                    The mass is the closest thing that you will find to a lifeboat now, and you are out of options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a bit of effort, and a lot of hope, you are able to shove the makeshift raft over the charred railing of the Valai.
                    With it in your hands, you jump across, taking it down with you.
                    The water is freezing cold, and thrashing you about without any care.
                    As you balance breathing in-between waves and climbing up onto the raft, you notice that you are moving farther and farther away from the Valai.
                    Perhaps you are moving towards freedom, or just as likely, towards your doom.
                    All you know right now, is that you have escaped this place of death with yourself intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adrenaline leaves your body. You feel yourself becoming incredibly tired, and the wet harsh plank of wood makes for the perfect pillow.
                    You fall into a deep, involuntary sleep.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    What will you do?
