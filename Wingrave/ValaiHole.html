                    You are able to sneak by before the Drogar notices you, and quickly climb up and out of the hold.
                    The others pouring in behind you are not so lucky, and are quickly targeted. 
                    They may yet live- you have no way of knowing. And so, you continue on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You emerge above-deck, immediately pelted by rain and flashes of lightning.
                    The Drogar have overrun the ship, and you can see their own vessel attached to the port side of the Valai.
                    From somewhere above you, where the rudder controls are located, you hear a man scream, followed by a few heavy stomps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You find some boxes to hide behind, and listen as the chaos continues. Some glass shatters in various spots across the boat- the Drogar are tossing containers filled with oil that light up in the blaze.
                    You can hear as the soldiers all walk up to the port side of the Valai and hop back onto their own vessel. Perhaps the siege has ended, and they are content to leave the ship to burn itself away.
                    No sooner does this thought cross your mind than a deafening crack pierces your ears. The smell of gunpowder isn't far behind.
                    The Drogar, as they detach from the ship and begin to drift away from it, fire a cannonball directly into the center mast of the ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pieces of the ship crumble under the force, and you find yourself crushed by a massive plane of planks held together with screws.
                    You take only a little solace in knowing that the attacking ship is sailing away.
                </p>
                <p>What will you do?</p>
