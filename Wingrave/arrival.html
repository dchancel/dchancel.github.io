                    Your eyes open with the crust of salty air on their lids, the corners of your mouth are dry and cracked.
                    The waves have pushed you and your hunk of wooden planks onto a craggy beach on the western side of Wingrave.
                    This is where your new life begins- with no belongings at all beyond what you are wearing.
