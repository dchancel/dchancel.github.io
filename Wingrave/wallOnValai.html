                    You notice an open crate of cargo with some tools packed into it, insulated with hay.
                    After some rapid digging, you are able to pull a hefty hammer from the box.
                    You aren't entirely comfortable with it, but there is enough adrenaline coursing through your veins to achieve most-anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a few well-placed strikes, you are able to beat through the wooden planks between this hold and the next, and enter through the newly-created hole.
                    The next hold is much less smokey, and filled entirely with cargo. As the other passengers begin to trickle in behind you, a large figure in dark metal armor steps into the doorway.
                    They are holding a large metal club, and their armor obscures any identifying features. They can see out through narrow slits in their helmet, but you are unable to see their eyes within.
                    Sharp metal spines protrude from their pauldrons, as well as their helmet. This is the military uniform of Drogar.

                <p>
                    You are not confident that your amateurish use of a hammer can stand up to a trained soldier of the Eastern Nations.
                    While you would like to protect the other passengers that you have been travelling with, that might come at the cost of your own survival.
                    You notice a hole in the ceiling of this hold that leads up onto the deck. A few boxes are stacked up near it, enough for you to climb up to it and ascend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What will you do?
