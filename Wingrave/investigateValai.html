                    You spring into action and rush out of the hold. The entryway, which is more of an open arch with a frame in it than anything else, leads into a corridor.
                    From here, you could access a number of other holds, or use the stairwell to ascend or descend.
                    In a more relaxed situation, you may have taken a moment to ponder what to do next, but right now your feet carry you up the stairs before you have time to think.
                    You emerge above-deck to find crew members fighting hand-to-hand with armored attackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the staccato strikes of lightning, you can make out the forms of the armor- a dark metal with sharp spines on the helmets and pauldrons, and narrow slits for the wearer's eyes.
                    These are the military uniforms of Drogar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crew is completely unprepared for an attack of this scale. They have the armaments and skills to deal with pirates and some lesser monsters, but not the military might of the Eastern Nations.
                    You can see that across from the port side of the ship, a larger vessel made of that same dark metal has attached itself to the Valai.
                    A commander, wearing more intricate armor and with a larger weapon, is standing up by the rudder controls.
                    In a single hand, he holds the captain of the Valai by the neck of his shirt, dangling him over the edge.
                    You are powerless to do anything in this moment, and before you can even step in their direction, the captain is dropped overboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have entered into a one-sided slaughter.
                    The Drogar soldiers do not care who they kill, so long as they wipe out their target: the mages.
                </p>

                    What will you do?
