                    You hurl an insult at the voice on the other side of the boxes.
                    Perhaps you hope for him to break them down to come after you personally, giving some of the other passengers a chance to escape.
                    No such thing happens, and instead he just laughs at you.

                    You are trapped in this room now, with the fire spreading all around you. Many of the passengers have already succumbed to the smoke.
                    Your vision starts to get hazy, and then dark. This is the end for you.
