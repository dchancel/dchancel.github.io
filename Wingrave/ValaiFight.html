                    You steel your nerves and prepare to fight the Drogar soldier. 
                    If you can distract them long enough for even one innocent to survive, then it will have been worth it.
                    They eye you with the body language of a killer, brandishing their weapon and beginning to stomp towards you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are unencumbered, and are able to dash through the hold with ease where the Drogar must clamber messily to get anywhere.
                    This is your only advantage, and you make use of it whenever possible.
                    You throw your hammer in the Drogar's general direction, and manage to hit their chestplate. Unfortunately, the hammer simply bounces off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you distract the Drogar on one side of the hold, away from the hole that you came in through, several people are able to sneak by undetected.
                    You do not know where they will go from here, but you know that you have done a good thing in a world that lacks such acts.
                    The Drogar has cornered you now, and is ready to finish this dance. You know that this is your final moment, but you take some reprieve in knowing that you left this world saving others.
